# Oomsi Landing Page Redesign — Figma AI Prompt

## Brand Foundation

**Company:** Oomsi — a property management system (PMS) for vacation rental owners and managers
**Website:** oomsi.com
**Mission:** Helping property owners unlock the full earning potential of their properties
**Tagline:** Every property has untapped potential. Oomsi unlocks it.
**Brand colors:** Teal/green (#3DB9A4 approx) as primary accent, dark navy for text, white/light gray backgrounds. Maintain current color palette.
**Tone:** Confident, professional, outcome-focused. Not "cheap" or "simple" — instead "smart" and "powerful but easy."

---

## Page Structure (Top to Bottom)

Design each section below in order. The page should flow as one continuous scroll with cohesive transitions between sections. Tighten spacing between sections compared to the current site — the current gaps are too large and make the page feel disconnected.

---

### Section 1: Sticky Navigation Bar

- Logo (left)
- Links: Features, How It Works, Pricing, Testimonials, Contact
- Right side: "Sign In" (text link) + "Start Free Trial" (filled teal button, high contrast)
- Nav should remain fixed/sticky on scroll
- The "Start Free Trial" button must be visually prominent at all times

---

### Section 2: Hero Section

**DO NOT use the old headline "Property management. Made simple."**
**DO NOT include a badge saying "#1 affordable PMS"**

**Layout:** Two columns — copy on the left, product visual on the right

**Left column:**
- Headline (large, bold): "Every property has untapped potential. Oomsi unlocks it."
- Subheadline (smaller, gray): "The all-in-one platform that helps property owners and managers earn more from every booking — with smarter tools, not more work."
- Primary CTA button (teal, large): "Start Your Free Trial →"
- Secondary CTA (outlined or text): "See How It Works ↓"
- Stats strip below CTAs — 4 items in a row:
  - "15 min" / Setup time
  - "3" / Platforms supported
  - "24/7" / WhatsApp alerts
  - "No booking fees" / Ever

**Right column:**
- Show an actual product screenshot of the Oomsi dashboard (NOT a stock photo of a vacation property)
- Overlay floating metric widgets: "$34.2k Revenue ↑18% vs last month" and "92% Occupancy This Month" (keep these from the current design, they work well — but anchor them on the real product UI, not a stock photo)

---

### Section 3: Social Proof Strip (NEW — does not exist on current site)

Directly below the hero, add a narrow strip with a single rotating testimonial quote and the customer's name/location/property count. Example: *"We cut our cleaning coordination time by 70% in the first month."* — Marco Rossi, 12 properties, Lake Como. This provides immediate social proof before the visitor scrolls further.

---

### Section 4: Platform Integration Logos

- Header text: "CONNECTS WITH YOUR FAVORITE PLATFORMS"
- Display actual logos (not text names) for: Airbnb, Booking.com, VRBO, WhatsApp, Google
- Logos should be grayscale/muted, arranged horizontally, evenly spaced
- Standard "trusted by" / "integrates with" visual pattern

---

### Section 5: Value Proposition Pillars (NEW — does not exist on current site)

Three columns, each with an icon, a short headline, and one sentence:

| Icon | Headline | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Revenue/chart icon | **Earn More** | Maximize occupancy and revenue with smart pricing tools and multi-channel distribution. |
| Clock/automation icon | **Work Less** | Automate messaging, reviews, and task management so you spend time on strategy, not admin. |
| Growth/scale icon | **Grow Faster** | Scale from 1 property to 100+ with tools that grow with your portfolio. |

Clean layout with generous padding. These pillars bridge the emotional hero promise with the functional features below.

---

### Section 6: Features Grid

- Section header: "Everything you need. Nothing you don't."
- Subheader: "Built specifically for vacation rental managers who want powerful tools without the complexity or the price tag."
- 3x3 grid of feature cards (or 2 rows of 4 + 1 CTA card)
- Each card has: icon, benefit-oriented headline, short description

**Feature cards (use benefit headlines, not feature names):**

1. **All your properties, one view.** — See occupancy, revenue, and today's tasks at a glance. No more switching between tabs. *(icon: house/dashboard)*
2. **One calendar. Zero double-bookings.** — Color-coded booking sources, direct bookings, blocked dates, all in one unified calendar. *(icon: calendar)*
3. **List everywhere, manage from one place.** — Connect Airbnb, Booking.com, and VRBO. Calendars, bookings, and rates sync automatically every hour. *(icon: globe/sync)*
4. **Cleaning on autopilot.** — A cleaning task is created automatically after every checkout. Your team uploads photos, you review them — all in one place. *(icon: checklist)*
5. **Your team, organized.** — Invite cleaners and maintenance staff. Assign them to properties, track their work, and manage hourly rates effortlessly. *(icon: people)*
6. **Your cleaners' own portal.** — Your cleaning team gets their own mobile portal. They see tasks, accept or decline, and upload photos — no app install needed. *(icon: phone)*
7. **Never miss an update.** — Task assignments, morning briefings, day-before reminders, and urgent pre-checkin alerts — all delivered straight to WhatsApp. *(icon: bell/notification)*
8. **Secure by design.** — Admin dashboard is separate from the cleaner portal. Invite-only access, so only your team can see your data. *(icon: shield)*

**DO NOT include "Guest Check-in (Coming Soon)" in this grid.** Only show live features. If space permits, the 9th card can be a CTA card: "See all features →" linking to a features page.

Consider adding small product screenshot thumbnails to each card, or a hover state that reveals a screenshot.

### Section 7: How It Works

- Section header: "Up and running in 15 minutes"
- Subheader: "No complex setup. No migration headaches. Just connect and go."
- 4 steps in alternating left/right layout (text on one side, visual on the other, alternating each step)

**Steps:**

1. **Add Your Properties** — Import from Airbnb or add manually. Set up bedrooms, check-in times, WiFi info, and cleaning photo requirements in minutes.
   - **Visual: Screenshot of the Oomsi property setup screen** (NOT a stock photo of a villa)

2. **Connect Your Channels** — Link Airbnb, Booking.com, and VRBO in a few clicks. Your bookings, rates, and availability sync automatically every hour.
   - **Visual: Screenshot of the channel connection interface** (NOT a stock photo of an apartment building)

3. **Build Your Team** — Invite your cleaners and maintenance staff by email. Assign them to properties with primary and backup roles.
   - **Visual: Screenshot of the team management/invitation screen** (NOT a stock photo of someone vacuuming)

4. **Let It Run** — Sit back. Cleaning tasks are created after every checkout, your team gets WhatsApp notifications, and your calendar stays perfectly in sync.
   - **Visual: Screenshot of the dashboard with active tasks** (NOT a stock photo of a fireplace)

**Add a CTA at the end of this section:** "Ready to try it? Start your free trial →"

### Section 8: Pricing

- Section header: "Simple, transparent pricing"

## Global Design Rules

- **CTA consistency:** Use "Start Free Trial" as the primary CTA everywhere. Do not alternate between "Try It Free," "Start Your 14-Day Trial," "Start 14-Day Free Trial," etc. One consistent phrase.
- **No stock photos in product sections.** Hero, How It Works, and Features should show the actual Oomsi UI. Stock photos of properties/people are acceptable only in testimonials or decorative backgrounds.
- **Mobile-first:** All sections must be fully responsive. Touch-friendly CTAs, legible text on small screens.
- **Whitespace:** Use generous but consistent spacing. Current site has excessive gaps between sections — reduce by ~30-40%.
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif. Headlines bold and large, body text readable at 16px+.
- **No emojis in the UI.**
